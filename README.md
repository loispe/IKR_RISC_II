# IKR RISC II Project
During the wintersemester 21/22 my fellow student Kenton and myself designed a RISC processor in VHDL. The architecture is based on the IKR RISC II of the Institute of Communication Networks and Computer Engineering at University of Stuttgart.
It follows the classic five stage RISC pipeline but implements a different ISA and does only allow word-adressable instead of byte-adressable memory.

## About this Repo
We submitted the project in July 2022 with a synthesizable 5 stage pipeline including fowarding and branch-functionalities. We testet and validated our design on a Terasic Cyclone V development board.

More details on the architecture will follow
